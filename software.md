  alt="screenshot of SoundThread">

SoundThread is a cross-platform user interface for The Composers Desktop Project (CDP) suite of sound manipulation tools. It allows for modular style routing of various CDP processes to quickly build up complex Threads that allow for extensive sound manipulation. The goal of SoundThread is to make CDP as user friendly as possible and it is particularly well suited to those new to experimental sound processing.

# jh.tools
Esoteric VST plugins made in Puredata compiled with [Camomile](https://github.com/pierreguillot/Camomile){:target="_blank"}. jh.tools plugins and source code are available [on github](https://github.com/j-p-higgins/jh.tools){:target="_blank"}.

  alt="screenshot of the mangle plugin">
A trio of distortions varying from gentle thickening to full sonic destruction. A multiband overdrive style distortion, a hard clipping distortion with control of the symmetry of the clipping and a '1-bit ADC' for turning all sounds into square waves. 

## Resonant Downsample

  alt="screenshot of the resonant downsample plugin">
Sample and hold being abused with a feedback loop so that it works like a weird resonant filter. Switchable anti-aliasing type filtering to reduce high frequency artifacts for a more subtle effect. Warning, can self oscillate which can be very loud. 

## L80s Reverb

  alt="screenshot of the l80s reverb plugin">
Relatively rubbish reverb that sounds like a cheap, reverb unit from the late 80s. Where this plugin is interesting is that you can modify the block size, overlap and sample rate of the reverb processing which gives effects similar to circuit bent reverb units. 

## Gloop

  alt="screenshot of the gloop plugin">
Dual mono looper/freeze effect with tremolo. No zero crossing point detection so often clicks and pops. Switch on random for instant Alva Noto.

  alt="screenshot of the bankpass plugin">

Small bank of four resonant bandpass filters. There is a feedback loop built in which can add extra sustain to the resonance on the filters, or if pushed will go into screaming self oscillation. Plugin can optionally be controlled via MIDI in either four voice polyphonic mode or in unison. When controlled with MIDI frequency sliders work as an offset and can be used similar to an additive synthesiser in mono (unison) mode. Settings for MIDI along with some other features including toggleable pre-programmed scales can be found in the advanced features tab.

  alt="screenshot of the euclidean sequencer and sample player">
The Euclidean Sequencer is a 16×16 step sequencer with MIDI and OSC output as well as sound file playback. It utilises a novel implementation of the Euclicean Algorithm to generate cyclic rhythmic patterns as outlined in Godfried Toussaint’s paper [“The Euclidean algorithm generates traditional musical rhythms”](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf){:target="_blank"}. The sequencer was designed to work with the [Mutable Instruments CV Pal Eurorack Module](https://mutable-instruments.net/archive/cvpal/manual/){:target="_blank"} for live modular synth performance however it can be configured to communicate with most hardware and software. 

# Jurassic Panner
 Jurassic Panner is a twenty in, eight out, flocking algorithm panner with OSC control built in Pure Data.   It makes use of the the Boids extention which is based on Simon Fraser’s implementation of Craig Reynolds’ Boids algorithm. Boids is a bird flight and animal flock simulator. It is the algorithm which was used in Jurassic Park for the herding dinosaurs. Jurassic Panner is available [on github](https://github.com/j-p-higgins/jurassic_panner){:target="_blank"}.


# Gesture Recognition and Electroacoustic Composition
jh.Leap tools is a suite of compositional tools developed in Pure Data that utilise gestural interaction via the Leap Motion device. The source for these tools is available on GitHub. The tools currently include a sampler, a changeable pattern multi channel panner, a tremolo and a reverb. As well as these major tools the suite also includes a large variety of smaller utilities which allow gesture recognition to be quickly implemented in new and existing Pure Data patches. The jh.Leap tools can be found [on github](https://github.com/j-p-higgins/jh.leap_tools){:target="_blank"}.
